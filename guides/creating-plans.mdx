Pricing plans are the foundation of your billing infrastructure. This guide walks you through creating a plan from draft to publication.

## Overview

Meteroid uses a versioned plan system where:
- Plans start as **drafts** that can be freely edited
- Drafts are **published** to make them available for subscriptions
- Multiple versions can coexist for different customers

<Steps>

<Step title="Create a draft plan">

Start by creating a draft plan using the PlansService. You'll need to specify the plan name, product family, type, and currency.

```protobuf
message CreateDraftPlanRequest {
  string name = 1;
  optional string description = 3;
  string product_family_local_id = 4;
  PlanType plan_type = 5;
  string currency = 6;
}
```

**Plan Types:**
- `STANDARD` - Regular paid plans with pricing components
- `FREE` - Free tier plans
- `CUSTOM` - Enterprise or custom negotiated plans

**Example Request:**

```json
{
  "name": "Professional Plan",
  "description": "Full-featured plan for growing teams",
  "product_family_local_id": "saas-platform",
  "plan_type": "STANDARD",
  "currency": "USD"
}
```

The response includes both plan details and the initial draft version:

```json
{
  "plan": {
    "id": "plan_01HX...",
    "name": "Professional Plan",
    "local_id": "professional",
    "plan_type": "STANDARD",
    "plan_status": "DRAFT",
    "draft_version_id": "ver_01HX..."
  },
  "version": {
    "id": "ver_01HX...",
    "is_draft": true,
    "version": 1,
    "currency": "USD"
  }
}
```

</Step>

<Step title="Configure plan settings">

Update the draft plan's overview settings including billing terms and metadata.

```protobuf
message UpdateDraftPlanOverviewRequest {
  string plan_version_id = 1;
  string plan_id = 2;
  string name = 3;
  optional string description = 4;
  string currency = 5;
  uint32 net_terms = 6;
}
```

**Example Request:**

```json
{
  "plan_id": "plan_01HX...",
  "plan_version_id": "ver_01HX...",
  "name": "Professional Plan",
  "description": "Includes 10 seats and 100GB storage",
  "currency": "USD",
  "net_terms": 30
}
```

**Net terms** define the payment due date (e.g., `30` = payment due within 30 days).

</Step>

<Step title="Add pricing components">

Pricing components define what customers pay for. Add components using the PriceComponentsService.

```protobuf
message CreatePriceComponentRequest {
  string plan_version_id = 1;
  string name = 2;
  ProductRef product = 7;
  repeated PriceEntry prices = 8;
}
```

**Common pricing component types:**

### Fixed subscription fee

```json
{
  "plan_version_id": "ver_01HX...",
  "name": "Base subscription",
  "product": {
    "new_product": {
      "name": "Base subscription",
      "fee_type": "SUBSCRIPTION",
      "fee_structure": {
        "rate": {}
      }
    }
  },
  "prices": [
    {
      "new_price": {
        "cadence": "MONTHLY",
        "currency": "USD",
        "rate_pricing": {
          "rate": "9900"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Usage-based component

```json
{
  "plan_version_id": "ver_01HX...",
  "name": "API calls",
  "product": {
    "new_product": {
      "name": "API usage",
      "fee_type": "USAGE",
      "fee_structure": {
        "usage": {
          "metric_id": "metric_api_calls"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "prices": [
    {
      "new_price": {
        "cadence": "MONTHLY",
        "currency": "USD",
        "usage_pricing": {
          "per_unit": {
            "per_unit_price": "10"
          },
          "metric_id": "metric_api_calls"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Slot-based (per seat) pricing

```json
{
  "plan_version_id": "ver_01HX...",
  "name": "User seats",
  "product": {
    "new_product": {
      "name": "User seats",
      "fee_type": "SLOT",
      "fee_structure": {
        "slot": {
          "unit": "seat",
          "upgrade_policy": "PRORATED",
          "downgrade_policy": "REMOVE_AT_END_OF_PERIOD"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "prices": [
    {
      "new_price": {
        "cadence": "MONTHLY",
        "currency": "USD",
        "slot_pricing": {
          "unit_price": "1500",
          "min_slots": 1,
          "max_slots": 100
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

<Note>
Prices are specified in the smallest currency unit (cents for USD). So `"9900"` = $99.00
</Note>

</Step>

<Step title="Configure trial settings (optional)">

Add a trial period to your plan to let customers try before they buy.

```protobuf
message UpdatePlanTrialRequest {
  string plan_id = 1;
  string plan_version_id = 2;
  TrialConfig trial = 3;
}

message TrialConfig {
  uint32 duration_days = 1;
  bool trial_is_free = 2;
  optional string trialing_plan_id = 3;
}
```

**Example Request:**

```json
{
  "plan_id": "plan_01HX...",
  "plan_version_id": "ver_01HX...",
  "trial": {
    "duration_days": 14,
    "trial_is_free": true
  }
}
```

Set `trial_is_free` to `false` if you want to charge the plan price during the trial period.

</Step>

<Step title="Publish the plan">

Once your draft is ready, publish it to make it available for subscriptions.

```protobuf
message PublishPlanVersionRequest {
  string plan_id = 1;
  string plan_version_id = 2;
}
```

**Example Request:**

```json
{
  "plan_id": "plan_01HX...",
  "plan_version_id": "ver_01HX..."
}
```

After publishing:
- The plan status changes to `ACTIVE`
- It becomes available for new subscriptions
- The version can no longer be edited
- You can create a new draft version for future changes

</Step>

</Steps>

## Plan versioning

Meteroid's versioning system allows you to evolve plans without affecting existing customers:

### Creating a new version

To create a new version based on an existing one:

```json
{
  "plan_id": "plan_01HX...",
  "plan_version_id": "ver_01HX..."
}
```

This copies the plan configuration to a new draft that you can modify and publish.

### Version strategy

- **Existing subscriptions** continue on their current version
- **New subscriptions** use the latest published version
- You can **grandfather** customers on old pricing indefinitely

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Keep plan names clear and descriptive">
Use names that clearly communicate value tier (Starter, Professional, Enterprise) and make it easy for customers to understand positioning.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Set appropriate net terms">
B2B SaaS typically uses 30-day net terms. Consumer products often use 0 (payment due immediately).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Start with fewer pricing components">
Begin with 2-3 core components (base fee + 1-2 usage metrics). Add complexity as you validate your pricing model.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use trials to reduce friction">
14-day free trials are common in SaaS. Credit card optional trials can increase conversion.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Version thoughtfully">
Create new versions for material pricing changes. Minor updates (description changes) can use UpdatePublishedPlanOverview.
</Accordion>
