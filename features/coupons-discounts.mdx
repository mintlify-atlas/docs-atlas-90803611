  discount_type: "percentage",
  discount_value: 20,
  duration: "repeating",
  duration_in_months: 3,
  max_redemptions: 100,
  expires_at: "2024-12-31"
});
```

## Coupon Configuration

### Discount Types

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Percentage">
    **Percentage discount** applied to subscription total:
    
    ```typescript
    {
      "code": "SAVE25",
      "discount_type": "percentage",
      "discount_value": 25  // 25% off
    }
    ```
    
    **Example**:
    - Subscription: $100/month
    - Discount: 25%
    - **Customer pays: $75/month**
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Fixed Amount">
    **Fixed dollar amount** off subscription:
    
    ```typescript
    {
      "code": "WELCOME50",
      "discount_type": "fixed",
      "discount_value": 50,  // $50 off
      "currency": "USD"
    }
    ```
    
    **Example**:
    - Subscription: $100/month
    - Discount: $50
    - **Customer pays: $50/month**
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Duration

Control how long the discount applies:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="One-time">
    Applies only to the first invoice.
    
    ```typescript
    {
      "duration": "once"
    }
    ```
    
    **Use case**: Welcome discount, promotional offer
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Repeating">
    Applies for a specified number of billing cycles.
    
    ```typescript
    {
      "duration": "repeating",
      "duration_in_months": 3  // Apply for 3 months
    }
    ```
    
    **Use case**: Limited-time promotion, seasonal offer
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Forever">
    Applies to all future invoices.
    
    ```typescript
    {
      "duration": "forever"
    }
    ```
    
    **Use case**: Loyalty discount, special pricing for specific customers
    
    <Warning>
    Use forever discounts carefully as they permanently reduce revenue.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Redemption Limits

### Max Redemptions
Limit total number of times a coupon can be used:

```typescript
{
  "code": "EARLYBIRD",
  "max_redemptions": 50  // First 50 customers only
}
```

### Expiration Date
Set when the coupon expires:

```typescript
{
  "code": "SUMMER2024",
  "expires_at": "2024-08-31T23:59:59Z"
}
```

### Per-customer Limit
Limit to one redemption per customer:

```typescript
{
  "code": "FIRSTTIME",
  "redeem_by_customer": true,  // Each customer can use once
  "max_redemptions": null      // No overall limit
}
```

## Applying Coupons

### During Checkout
Customers can enter coupon codes at checkout:

```typescript
// Checkout with pre-applied coupon
await meteroid.checkout.create({
  customer_id: "cust_abc",
  plan_id: "plan_pro",
  coupon_code: "LAUNCH20"
});

// Or let customer enter code in checkout UI
```

### Programmatically
Apply coupons directly to subscriptions:

```typescript
await meteroid.subscriptions.update({
  subscription_id: "sub_xyz",
  coupon_code: "LOYALTY15"
});
```

### Via Admin
Manually apply coupons in the web UI for customer support scenarios.

## Common Discount Strategies

### Welcome Discount
Encourage sign-ups with a first-month discount:

```typescript
{
  "code": "WELCOME",
  "discount_type": "percentage",
  "discount_value": 50,
  "duration": "once"
}
```

### Extended Trial
Offer longer trial periods:

```typescript
{
  "code": "TRIAL60",
  "trial_days": 60  // Override default 14-day trial
}
```

### Seasonal Promotion
Time-limited promotional offers:

```typescript
{
  "code": "BLACKFRIDAY",
  "discount_type": "percentage",
  "discount_value": 35,
  "duration": "repeating",
  "duration_in_months": 12,
  "expires_at": "2024-11-30",
  "max_redemptions": 500
}
```

### Referral Discount
Reward customers who refer others:

```typescript
// Unique code per referrer
{
  "code": `REFERRAL_${referrer_id}`,
  "discount_type": "fixed",
  "discount_value": 25,
  "duration": "once",
  "redeem_by_customer": true
}
```

### Loyalty Discount
Reward long-term customers:

```typescript
{
  "code": "LOYAL_CUSTOMER",
  "discount_type": "percentage",
  "discount_value": 15,
  "duration": "forever"
}
```

## Discount Application Rules

### What Gets Discounted

Coupons apply to:
- ✅ Recurring subscription fees
- ✅ One-time setup fees (if configured)
- ❌ Usage-based charges (excluded by default)
- ❌ Taxes

### Multiple Coupons

<Note>
Only one coupon can be active per subscription at a time. Applying a new coupon replaces the existing one.
</Note>

### Minimum Purchase

Require minimum subscription value:

```typescript
{
  "code": "BIG50",
  "discount_type": "fixed",
  "discount_value": 50,
  "minimum_amount": 200  // Requires $200+ subscription
}
```

## Analytics

Track coupon performance:

- **Redemptions**: Total times used
- **Revenue impact**: Total discount given
- **Conversion rate**: Checkouts with vs without coupon
- **Customer LTV**: Compare coupon users to non-coupon users

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Coupon Code Design">
    **Create memorable, meaningful codes**:
    
    ✅ Good codes:
    - `LAUNCH20` (clear purpose and value)
    - `SUMMER2024` (seasonal context)
    - `FRIEND25` (referral indication)
    
    ❌ Avoid:
    - `PROMO1` (generic, forgettable)
    - `XJ7K2P` (hard to type, no meaning)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Discount Strategy">
    **Balance acquisition cost with LTV**:
    
    - Start with small discounts (10-20%)
    - Test different durations (1 month vs 3 months)
    - Track conversion rates and churn
    - Avoid discounting too deeply (>50%)
    - Use one-time discounts for trials
    - Reserve forever discounts for VIP customers
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Expiration Management">
    **Create urgency without being pushy**:
    
    - Set reasonable expiration dates (30-90 days)
    - Extend expiring popular coupons
    - Notify customers before expiration
    - Archive expired coupons for historical tracking
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Fraud Prevention">
    **Protect against coupon abuse**:
    
    - Set max redemptions for high-value coupons
    - Enable one-per-customer limits
    - Monitor unusual redemption patterns
    - Use unique codes for referral programs
    - Disable suspicious coupons immediately
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
