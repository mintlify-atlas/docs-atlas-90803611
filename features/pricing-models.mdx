**Configuration**:
- Billing period: Monthly, quarterly, annual, or custom

### Usage-based Fees
Variable charges calculated from metered usage.

#### Per-Unit Pricing
Fixed rate per unit consumed:
```
$0.10 per API call
$5.00 per compute hour

0-10,000 requests: $0.10 each
10,001-50,000 requests: $0.08 each
50,001+ requests: $0.05 each
```

**Total cost for 25,000 requests**:
- First 10,000 × $0.10 = $1,000
- Next 15,000 × $0.08 = $1,200
- **Total: $2,200**

#### Volume Pricing
Single rate applied to entire volume based on total usage:
```
0-10,000 requests: $0.10 each
10,001-50,000 requests: $0.08 each (all units)
50,001+ requests: $0.05 each (all units)

**Total cost for 25,000 requests**:
- All 25,000 × $0.08 = **$2,000**

#### Package Pricing
Bundles with overage charges:
```
$100 for 10,000 API calls
$0.015 for each additional call
```

**Cost for 15,000 calls**:

### Slot-based Fees

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Simple">
    Begin with simple pricing and add complexity as needed:
    1. Start with fixed subscription fees
    2. Add usage-based components for key metrics
    3. Introduce tiers as customer base grows
    4. Add advanced features like matrix pricing when needed
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Price Testing">
    Test pricing before going live:
    - Create draft plans and preview invoices
    - Run calculations with sample data
    - Verify proration logic with mid-cycle changes
    - Test edge cases (zero usage, high volume)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Customer Communication">
    Ensure pricing is clear to customers:
    - Document pricing models in your terms
    - Show usage meters in customer dashboards
