## Pricing Models

### Per-Unit Pricing
Charge a fixed rate per unit consumed.

**Example**: $0.10 per API call

### Tiered Pricing
Different rates for different usage ranges.

**Example**:
- 0-10,000 API calls: $0.10 each
- 10,001-100,000: $0.08 each
- 100,001+: $0.05 each

### Volume Pricing
Rate applies to entire volume based on highest tier reached.

**Example**: If you use 15,000 API calls, all 15,000 are charged at $0.08 each.

### Package Pricing
Bundles of units with overage charges.

**Example**: $100 for 10,000 API calls, then $0.015 per additional call
