## Subscription Configuration

### Billing Cycles
- **Monthly**: Bill every month on the anniversary date
- **Quarterly**: Bill every 3 months
- **Annual**: Bill once per year
- **Custom**: Define any billing frequency

### Activation Conditions
Control when subscriptions become active:
- **Immediate**: Activate as soon as created
- **Date-based**: Start on a specific date
- **Payment confirmation**: Wait for payment method setup

### Component Customization
Customize subscription components per customer:
- **Parameterization**: Override metric aggregations or filters
- **Fee overrides**: Adjust pricing for specific customers
- **Add-ons**: Attach optional features or services

## Common Operations

### Creating Subscriptions
Create subscriptions via the web UI, API, or checkout sessions:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript API
const subscription = await api.subscriptions.create({
  customer_id: "cust_abc123",
  plan_id: "plan_pro_monthly",
  billing_start: "2024-02-01",
  activated: true
});
```

```typescript Checkout
// Let customers self-serve through checkout
const checkout = await api.checkout.create({
  customer_id: "cust_abc123",
  plan_id: "plan_pro_monthly"
});
```
</CodeGroup>

### Upgrading Plans
Schedule plan changes with automatic proration:

<Info>
When upgrading mid-cycle, Meteroid automatically:
1. Calculates unused time on the old plan
2. Issues credit for the prorated amount
3. Charges for the new plan from the change date
</Info>

### Managing Slots
For per-seat pricing, adjust slots during the billing period:

- **Add seats**: Prorated charges for remaining period
- **Remove seats**: Prorated credits on next invoice
- **Bulk changes**: Update multiple seats at once

### Cancellation Options

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="End of Period">
    Subscription remains active until the end of the current billing period, then cancels automatically.
    
    **Use case**: Customer wants to finish their paid period
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Immediate">
    Subscription cancels immediately. Prorated credits may be issued.
    
    **Use case**: Immediate termination with refund
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Scheduled">
    Cancel on a specific future date.
    
    **Use case**: Known end date for contract
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Subscription Analytics

Track subscription health and metrics:
- **MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)**: Current subscription value
- **Churn rate**: Cancellation tracking
- **Expansion revenue**: Upgrades and add-ons
