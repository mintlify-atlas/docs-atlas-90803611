Credit notes allow you to issue refunds, make corrections to invoices, and provide customer credits in a compliant, auditable way.

## What are Credit Notes?

A credit note is a document that reduces the amount owed by a customer. It's used instead of modifying finalized invoices to maintain a complete audit trail.

## Creating Credit Notes

### For Invoice Corrections

Credit a specific invoice:

```typescript
const creditNote = await meteroid.creditNotes.create({
  invoice_id: "inv_abc123",
  reason: "Billing error",
  items: [
    {
      description: "Overcharged API usage",
      amount: 150.00
    }
  ]
});
```

### For Customer Balance

Add credit to customer account:

```typescript
const creditNote = await meteroid.creditNotes.create({
  customer_id: "cust_abc",
  reason: "Service downtime compensation",
  amount: 100.00,
  apply_to_balance: true
});
```

## Credit Note Types

### Full Refund

Credit the entire invoice amount:

```typescript
{
  "invoice_id": "inv_xyz",
  "type": "full_refund",
  "reason": "Subscription canceled within refund window"
}
```

**Example**:
- Original invoice: $299.00
- Credit note: -$299.00
- **Net amount owed: $0.00**

### Partial Refund

Credit a portion of an invoice:

```typescript
{
  "invoice_id": "inv_xyz",
  "type": "partial_refund",
  "amount": 100.00,
  "reason": "Prorated refund for early cancellation"
}
```

**Example**:
- Original invoice: $299.00
- Credit note: -$100.00
- **Net amount owed: $199.00**

### Line Item Credit

Credit specific line items:

```typescript
{
  "invoice_id": "inv_xyz",
  "type": "line_item_credit",
  "items": [
    {
      "line_item_id": "line_456",
      "description": "Incorrect usage calculation",
      "amount": 50.00
    }
  ]
}
```

## Application Methods

### Automatic Balance Application

Credits automatically reduce future invoices:

```typescript
// Credit note adds $100 to customer balance
{
  "customer_id": "cust_abc",
  "amount": 100.00,
  "apply_to_balance": true
}

// Next invoice automatically applies credit
// Invoice total: $299.00
// Credit applied: -$100.00
// Amount due: $199.00
```

### Refund to Payment Method

Refund money back to original payment method:

```typescript
{
  "invoice_id": "inv_xyz",
  "amount": 150.00,
  "refund_to_payment_method": true,
  "payment_intent_id": "pi_stripe_abc"  // Original payment
}
```

<Info>
Refunds via Stripe typically process within 5-10 business days.
</Info>

### Manual Application

Manually select which invoice(s) to credit:

```typescript
await meteroid.creditNotes.apply({
  credit_note_id: "cn_xyz",
  invoice_ids: ["inv_abc", "inv_def"]
});
```

## Common Scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cancellation Refund">
    **Customer cancels mid-cycle and requests refund**:
    
    1. Calculate unused time:
       - Canceled on day 15 of 30-day cycle
       - 15 days remaining = 50% unused
    
    2. Create prorated credit:
    ```typescript
    const creditNote = await meteroid.creditNotes.create({
      invoice_id: lastInvoice.id,
      amount: lastInvoice.amount * 0.5,
      reason: "Prorated refund for mid-cycle cancellation",
      refund_to_payment_method: true
    });
    ```
    
    3. Process refund to original payment method
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Billing Error Correction">
    **Overcharged customer due to misconfigured pricing**:
    
    1. Identify affected invoices and amounts
    2. Create credit notes for each invoice:
    ```typescript
    for (const invoice of affectedInvoices) {
      await meteroid.creditNotes.create({
        invoice_id: invoice.id,
        amount: invoice.overcharge_amount,
        reason: "Billing error correction - pricing misconfiguration",
        apply_to_balance: true  // Apply to future invoices
      });
    }
    ```
    
    3. Notify customer of correction
    4. Update pricing configuration
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Service Credit">
    **Downtime or service issues warrant compensation**:
    
    1. Determine appropriate credit amount
    2. Issue as account credit:
    ```typescript
    await meteroid.creditNotes.create({
      customer_id: "cust_affected",
      amount: 50.00,  // e.g., 1 day's prorated value
      reason: "Service downtime on 2024-02-15",
      apply_to_balance: true,
      notify_customer: true
    });
    ```
    
    3. Send apology email with explanation
    4. Credit automatically reduces next invoice
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Goodwill Gesture">
    **Provide credit for customer satisfaction**:
    
    ```typescript
    // One-time goodwill credit
    await meteroid.creditNotes.create({
      customer_id: "cust_vip",
      amount: 100.00,
      reason: "Thank you for your continued partnership",
      apply_to_balance: true
    });
    ```

    - Customer complaint resolution
    - Loyalty appreciation
    - Partnership negotiation
    - Trial extension
